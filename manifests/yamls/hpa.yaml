HPA operates as a continuous control loop (defaulting to every 15 seconds). 
Monitor: It queries the Metrics Server to get the current CPU and memory usage of all pods in a target workload.
Calculate: It uses a ratio-based formula to determine the necessary number of pods:
Example: If you have 2 pods at 80% CPU and your target is 40%, 
HPA will scale up to 4 pods to halve the load per pod.
Scale: It updates the replicas field of the target workload. Kubernetes then creates or deletes pods to reach that number.
